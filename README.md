# retrieve-zn-ipfs-seedlist

External tool to retrieve the seed list from ZeroNet / IPFS.

## Description

This tool downloads and saves the seedlist in the current directory. The
Stellite daemon can then use this file as the initial seed list instead
of the hardcoded ones.

## Current status

Currently the tool downloads the seed list directly from IPFS only. No ZeroNet
stuff going on yet
